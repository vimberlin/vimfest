    <p>
    I will highlight some of the more advanced uses of maps:

    <ul>
      <li>Extending maps with expressions and VimScript</li>
      <li>Maps for the Vim command-line</li>
      <li>A short digression on custom completion for ex-commands (using <code>tab</code>) [*]</li>
      <li>Custom completion on the command-line using maps (e.g. <code>CTRL+P</code> style completion)</li>
      <li>Putting it all together to make your plug-ins (in lack of a better word) sparkle [*]</li>
    </ul>

    With a bit of effort and a few recurring tricks you can match or even improve upon the comfort the command-line completion your shell offers. Authors of plug-ins will hopefully find some interesting suggestions, but normal users of Vim can improve their workflow as well.
