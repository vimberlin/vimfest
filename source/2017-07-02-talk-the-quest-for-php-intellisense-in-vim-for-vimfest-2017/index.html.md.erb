    <p>VIM currently lacks many of the introspection and completion features
(Intellisense) for PHP that are taken from granted in IDEs such as PHPStorm. Despite
this handicap many PHP developers still opt to use VIM because of its speed and
power.</p>
    <p>The reason for this lack would perhaps be the amount of time and effort required
to implement these features, many projects have been started, none (of which I
am aware) have succeeded in becoming stable solutions.</p>
    <p>In this talk Dan will discuss his view of the quest for PHP
intellisense in VIM and a new PHP refactoring tool (and VIM plugin) which he has been
working on.</p>
