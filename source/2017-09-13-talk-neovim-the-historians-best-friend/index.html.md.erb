    Historians write a lot of text. A helpful and supportive editor is crucial for their day to day work. In this talk I will introduce some of neo/vim's features and plugins I find most useful while dealing with text. Apart from several vim commands and settings, I will go into detail especially with regard to editing LaTeX and markdown files as well as using git.
